# Cintinious integration principles

The story above is the overview of CI and how it works in daily life. Getting all this to work smoothly is obviously rather more than that. I'll focus now on the key practices that make up effective CI.

- Maintain a Single Source Repository.
- Automate the Build
- Make Your Build Self-Testing
- Everyone Commits To the Mainline Every Day
- Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine
- Fix Broken Builds Immediately
- Keep the Build Fast
- Test in a Clone of the Production Environment
- Make it Easy for Anyone to Get the Latest Executable
- Everyone can see what's happening
- Automate Deployment
